# TODO

## Features

- Normalise relative deadline for reports: the next day at 2am wrt. the theoretical value
- A unique log to store login, logout and every update
- automate surveys management:
	1. pre-made mails are send directly at a given deadline (mail include deadline)
	2. automatic reminder
- iCal sync for each user:	
	- student get their deadlines
	- tutors get students deadline & review deadlines
	- no file. Sync with the server to stay aligned with the current status (new deadlines, report submitted, etc.)
- rewrite status page


## Development

- clean a bit the code
- tests and comments
- simplify DB with less fake values and more optional fields hidden in JSONs
